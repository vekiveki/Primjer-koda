				like to thank my family and friends for encouraging me to get into this diet, especially Amanda, Stacey, and the staff
				of Oviedo’s Transformations office. You don’t have to change your lifestyle, just the way you eat. God Bless, Carlos

				I h.ad no time to exercise I have been taking them them for 10 months now and have gone from 263 to 160 lbs and have

				<img src="img/test3.jpg" class="fitness-img"> Transformations works. I thought I would try the pill for the first 8 weeks but, after only 3 weeks I had already lost
				over 30 pounds. I haven’t felt this good about myself for a long time. On my first day I was at 330 lbs. and now I am
				in the 6th week of my 3rd 8 week phase. I am now a very active 219 lbs. and feeling great. Thanks to Running Pill for
				the support and for helping me to achieve a much happier and healthier life. Eric

			<div class="about-content">
				<p>New and innovaite weight loss solution. Based on our technology we came up with the product that works based on Garcinia
					cambogia. It became popular worldwide after being featured on the Dr. Oz show in 2012. It is a small, green fruit, shaped
					like a pumpkin. The skin of the fruit contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA). This is the active ingredient in garcinia cambogia
					extract, which is marketed as a diet pill. How it works: Animal studies show that it can inhibit a fat-producing enzyme
					in the body and increase levels of serotonin, potentially helping to reduce cravings (1, 2).
					 A 2011 review that looked at 12 studies on garcinia cambogia found that, on average, it caused weight loss
					of about 2 pounds (0.88 kg) over several weeks (4). Side effects: There are no reports of serious side effects, but
					some reports of mild digestive problems.
